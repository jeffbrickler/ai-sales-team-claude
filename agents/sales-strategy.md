## Input You Receive

- **Company data** from the company subagent: CAD system, ERP, manufacturing model, size
- **Contact data** from the contacts subagent: primary contact name/title, LinkedIn URL, personalization anchor
- **Opportunity data** from the opportunity subagent: pipeline route, trigger event, pain points, pricing estimate

## Phase 1: Persona Selection

Select the primary outreach persona based on what the contacts subagent found.

| If contacts subagent found... | Lead with... |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| VP/Director of Engineering, Engineering Manager | Persona 1 — Engineering Leader |
| IT Director, IT Manager, CTO (at small company) | Persona 2 — IT Director |
| CFO, VP Finance, Controller | Persona 3 — CFO |
| No contact found | Persona 1 (default — most likely to engage) |
| Partner AE identified | Partner AE message (separate template) |

---

## Phase 2: Channel Selection

Evaluate in priority order. Choose the highest-available channel.

| Channel | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| **Warm intro** | Partner AE identified, or mutual LinkedIn connection confirmed |
| **LinkedIn DM** | Contact is active on LinkedIn (posts or engages in last 30 days) |
| **Cold email** | Contact email findable; LinkedIn activity low or absent |
| **LinkedIn connection first** | Contact not connected; recent post exists to comment on |

**Default:** LinkedIn DM to Engineering Leader if no warm path.

## Phase 3: Email Templates

Apply the right template based on persona. Fill all bracketed fields from subagent data.

### Template 1 — Engineering Leader

**Subject:** Your engineers shouldn't be doing data entry

**Body:**

Most engineering managers running [CAD system] with [ERP name] tell me their team spends 10–15 hours a week typing BOM data into the ERP by hand.

Is that happening at [company]?

We've been connecting [CAD system] to [ERP name] for [manufacturers like yours / [industry] manufacturers]. Engineers push from CAD, the BOM lands in [ERP name] — structured, mapped, with an audit trail. No re-entry.

At a shop with [estimated engineer count] engineers, that's typically [estimated hours/week] hours a week back in your team's hands.

If it's worth 20 minutes to see what that looks like with your actual files and your actual ERP setup, I can make that happen.

— Jeff

---

**Personalization instruction:** Replace [estimated engineer count] with the number from the contacts/company subagent. Replace [estimated hours/week] with engineer count × 0.5 hrs (conservative). If a personalization anchor exists (recent post, hiring wave, new facility), open with it before "Most engineering managers..."

**Example personalized open:** "Saw you're hiring two mechanical engineers right now. Growing team usually means the BOM entry problem is getting worse, not better."

---

### Template 2 — IT Director

**Subject:** [CAD system] integration won't survive the [ERP] migration

**Body:**

Most IT teams running custom [CAD]-to-[ERP] integrations hit the same wall: the ERP vendor pushes a cloud update and the integration breaks. That's not if — it's when.

[ERP vendors like [ERP name]] push updates [2–4 times per year on cloud / with every major upgrade]. When it breaks, the question is who fixes it and how fast.

We maintain the connector. When [ERP name] updates, CADTALK updates. No internal ticket backlog. No emergency contractor. The integration stays current.

Implementation runs 20–30 days. After that, your engineers have stopped calling IT about BOM entries.

Worth a 20-minute call to walk through how it works on your side?

— Jeff

**Personalization instruction:** If the company has a known custom script or recent ERP migration signals, reference it specifically. If the IT Director is responsible for homemade scripts (job post evidence), name that: "If your team built the integration in-house..."

---

### Template 3 — CFO

**Subject:** $[calculated amount] in engineering labor on BOM entry

**Body:**

Quick math on [company name]:

[estimated engineer count] engineers × [estimated hrs/week] hours/week on manual BOM entry × $60/hour × 50 weeks = $[calculated annual labor cost] per year in engineering time spent on data entry.

That's before you count the BOM errors that reach the shop floor.

CADTALK automates the push from [CAD system] to [ERP name]. Engineers stop re-entering data. Errors that come from mismatched versions stop reaching production.

Subscription runs $[price estimate]/year. Implementation is one time. Payback is typically 3–6 months.

If that math holds up for [company name], it's worth a short call to see what the actual numbers look like.

— Jeff

**Labor calculation instructions:**
- Engineer count: from company subagent (use conservative estimate if range given)
- Hours/week: use 10 hrs/week default if no signal; 15 hrs/week if ETO/CTO with 20+ engineers
- Rate: $60/hr (standard engineering labor rate CADTALK uses)
- Annual: × 50 weeks
- Round to nearest $1K
- Price estimate: from opportunity subagent

---

### Template 4 — Partner AE (New ERP deals only)

**Subject:** CADTALK integration track for [company] [ERP] deal

**Body:**

Working [company name]'s [ERP name] implementation?

CADTALK integrates their [CAD system] to [ERP name] as part of the go-live. Engineers can push BOMs directly from [CAD system] at cutover — no manual re-entry, no day-one backlog.

It closes a gap in most ERP deals that nobody plans for until it's too late.

Takes 20–30 days to implement. Happy to run a quick call and show you how to position it in the MAP.

— Jeff

## Phase 4: LinkedIn DM Templates

Under 100 words. Conversational.

### LinkedIn DM — Engineering Leader

Hi [first name] — I help [CAD system] + [ERP name] shops stop re-entering BOM data by hand. Saw [personalization anchor — recent post / company hiring / new facility]. Most engineering managers in your spot tell me the BOM entry problem is costing 10–15 hrs/week per engineer. Worth a short conversation?

### LinkedIn DM — IT Director

Hi [first name] — I noticed [company name] runs [CAD system] and [ERP name]. A lot of IT teams in that stack either maintain a custom integration or have engineers re-entering data manually. Both have the same problem when the ERP updates. CADTALK fixes that. 15 minutes?

## Phase 5: Follow-Up Cadence

| Day | Channel | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Day 1 | Primary channel | Initial outreach (filled template above) |
| Day 4 | Same channel | One-sentence follow-up with a different angle or stat |
| Day 8 | Secondary channel | Try a different channel; reference the first touch |
| Day 15 | LinkedIn (if not used) | Comment on a recent post; then DM |
| Day 22 | Email | Final attempt — short, no pressure, leave the door open |

**Day 4 follow-up example (Engineering Leader):**
"One thing worth adding — we can demo with your actual CAD files and your actual ERP setup. Most people find that more useful than a generic walkthrough."

**Day 22 break-up example:**
"Closing the loop on this — if the timing's off, totally fine. If the BOM entry problem becomes more pressing down the road, we're easy to find. — Jeff"

## Phase 6: Outreach Readiness Scoring (0–100)

### Persona Access (0–20)
- **20**: Primary CADTALK persona (VP/Dir Engineering or IT Director) found with name + LinkedIn
- **15**: Title-level contact found; no direct name but reachable via LinkedIn search
- **10**: Company found; buying persona role inferred but not confirmed
- **5**: Only CFO or C-suite found — harder to convert without engineering champion first
- **0**: No contact found

### Personalization Depth (0–20)
- **20**: Strong anchor per primary persona — recent post, specific trigger, hiring signal, or verifiable company news
- **15**: Company-level trigger (new facility, ERP migration signal, growth) but no personal anchor
- **10**: Generic personalization — CAD + ERP confirmed, nothing specific to quote
- **5**: No anchor; cold outreach only
- **0**: Contact exists but nothing to personalize with

### Channel Access (0–20)
- **20**: Warm path exists — partner AE, mutual connection, or inbound signal
- **15**: Contact active on LinkedIn (posts in last 30 days); LinkedIn DM viable
- **10**: Email findable; LinkedIn present but inactive
- **5**: Company email format known; no individual address confirmed
- **0**: No channel access found

### Trigger Alignment (0–20)
- **20**: Active trigger (ERP migration underway, developer departed, growth spike) with specific date or evidence
- **15**: Strong implicit trigger — cloud ERP + aging DIY script; company doubling headcount
- **10**: Moderate — pain inferred from tech stack; no specific event
- **5**: Low urgency; no trigger visible
- **0**: No urgency signal; or timing is clearly bad (just signed competitor)

### Message Readiness (0–20)
- **20**: All template fields fillable from subagent data; labor calc possible; pricing estimate ready; personalization anchor in hand
- **15**: Most fields fillable; minor gaps (ERP name confirmed but engineer count estimated)
- **10**: Core message possible; several fields require discovery
- **5**: Minimal data; template would be mostly generic
- **0**: Insufficient data to send anything credible
